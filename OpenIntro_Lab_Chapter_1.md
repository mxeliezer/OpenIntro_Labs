OpenIntro Lab - Chapter 1
=========================

## Introduction to data ##

This notebook is the first chapter of my personal study book. The general aim is to learn how summarize and describe the raw information - the data. It is part of the first set of **OpenIntro** labs, that are part of the study of the book: **Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation**. Lab avaliable from: [Introducton to Data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R/blob/master/intro_to_data/intro_to_data.html)

We will use a data set collected by the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC), called **The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System** (BRFSS). Avaliable from: [BRFSS](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss).

This R Notebooke is organized in the following way: there will always be a question about the dataset, followed by code chunks (R script) and its outputs. For some answers the output will be considered sufficient. For others a short answer will be written.

We will focus on a random sample of 20,000 people from the **BRFSS** survey conducted in 2000. While there are over 200 variables in this data set, we will work with a small subset.
