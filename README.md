OpenIntro Labs Notebooks
========================

This R Notebooks are created from the exercises proposed by OpenIntro Labs. That are part of the study of the book **Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation**. Avaliable from: [ISRS](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/).

The book brings a practical approach to learning statistics, including a series of exercises, called Labs, that include learning challenges through the use of software.

The technology chosen for data analysis was:
1. The programming language **R**, through **Rstudio**;
2. Using **R notebook**, through **R markdown**.

For each shared notebook, sources, references and links to datasets and other documentation will be provided.

This work is only aimed at the development of my personal study goals, without any commercial or lucrative purpose. 

Despite this, I hope that it can be useful to those who are treading their path of learning with Rstudio, Data Science or statistics.
