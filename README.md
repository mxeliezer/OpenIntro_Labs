OpenIntro Labs Notebooks
========================
This repository contains notebooks, created from the exercises proposed by OpenIntro Labs. That are part of the study of the book **Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation**. Avaliable from: [ISRS](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/). The book brings a practical approach to learning statistics, including a series of exercises, called Labs, that include learning challenges through the use of software.

The technology chosen for data analysis was the programming language **R**.
Various interfaces will be used depending on each case. We will use:
1. R script, through Rstudio; 
2. R notebook, through Rmarkdown;
3. R notebook, through Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook).

For each shared notebook, sources, references and links to datasets and other documentation will be provided.
